GOAT Grind Style – Premium Streetwear Store
Live Demo → https://goat-grind-style.vercel.app

What is GOAT Grind Style?
A sleek, high-performance streetwear e-commerce store built from the ground up with modern tech stack — designed for speed, style, and conversions.
Think Supreme meets daily drops, but fully coded by one developer (me).
This is not a template — every line of code, every animation, every detail was hand-crafted to look and feel premium.
✨ Features

Fully responsive (mobile-first – looks insane on phones)
Blazing-fast loading with Vite + React 18
Clean Tailwind CSS design (black/red/dark mode streetwear aesthetic)
Functional shopping cart with add/remove/update quantity
Smooth hover effects & micro-interactions
Product grid with categories (Hoodies, Tees, Caps, Accessories)
Beautiful product cards with “Add to Bag” that actually works
Cart sidebar that slides in/out like real premium stores
Ready for Stripe/PayFast integration (just add your keys)

🛠️ Tech Stack

React 18 + Vite (lightning fast builds)
TypeScript (clean, type-safe code)
Tailwind CSS (no bulky CSS files, fully custom)
React Icons & custom animations
Local state management (Context API ready if you want to scale)
Deployed on Vercel (zero config)

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out
Most junior portfolios have Todo apps or basic landings.
I built a real-world, production-ready e-commerce store that could launch tomorrow and start taking orders.
Recruiters see this and instantly know:

I can build pixel-perfect UIs
I understand state management in real apps
I care about performance, responsiveness, and user experience
I ship clean, organized, scalable code
